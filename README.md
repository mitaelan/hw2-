Your homework is to finish the alphabet. Write functions that draw each letter, from A to Z. In class, we started off using a very blocky style with simple lines, but you can be as creative as you like with your own font. In addition to lines, you can use rectangles, ellipses, or any of the other shapes listed on the P5 reference page
